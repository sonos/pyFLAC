Examples
--------

:download:`passthrough.py <../examples/passthrough.py>`

Read a WAV file and pass the audio through the encoder/decoder for the purposes of illustration. ::

      python3 passthrough.py

This example asserts that the uncompressed data is exactly equal to the original signal.

:download:`stream.py <../examples/stream.py>`

Stream audio from the microphone input and pass through the encoder printing the effectiveness
of the compression to the terminal. ::

      python3 stream.py

.. note::
      This example requires `sounddevice`, which can be installed with pip.
      See the `sounddevice <https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/>`_ documentation for more information.


Limitations
-----------

- pyFLAC currently only supports 16-bit audio.
- FLAC metadata handling is not implemented.
